# Testing Randomization of Die and Cards 

- Utilizing JQuery to randomize die and card values, this project has a few different code blocks in it. 
- The final product was a small card shuffler that also deals cards, that once scaled could be used to play a game of poker with either another user or a computer
- I created the graphics for each of the cards with Illustrator to bring in some visual impact, due to the simple nature of what was being made. 

## Tools
- JQuery
- Illustrator
